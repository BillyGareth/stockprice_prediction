The feasibility and accuracy of the Associated Net are verified by comparing the model with LSTM network model and the LSTM deep-recurrent neural network model. Multiple data sets were used to verify the applicability of Associated Net model. Experiments show that the average accuracy of Associated Net model is not only better than that of the other two models. Moreover, it can predict multiple values simultaneously, and the average accuracy of each predicted value is over 95%. Although the model achieves good effect, there are still some aspects can be improved. For example, simple arithmetic mean algorithm is used in the calculation of total loss in training phase, and the goal is to optimize the model by reducing the total loss. This loss calculation method does not take into count the relationship between each sub-loss, as well as some details when the total loss is the minimum, such as the extreme situation of each sub-loss and the oscillation in the process of loss reduction. In the next step, we will study the dimension reduction of the input parameters and the optimizing the loss calculation method to improve the average accuracy of the model.
